    <h2>Founding of CJ's Potato Chips</h2>
    <p>I founded CJ's Potato Chips in 2024 as the effects of inflation were causing a decrease in
    quality of snacks and an increase of price. I had noticed a large market for affordable, tasty
    potato chips and decided that I would try my hand at making them myself. This business started
    as just a small home business, selling my products at a local farmers market, but our products
    were more popular than we could have expected. Now we have, and still are quickly expanding, while
    still controlling our growth to avoid the high expenses other chip companies have that make a price
    similar to ours unachievable.</p>

    <h2>About Our Products</h2>
    <p>All products made at CJ's Potato Chips are made with a focus on quality. We have an ever
    expanding selection of flavors, which includes, original, barbeque, sour cream and onion,
    cheddar, and jalapeno. </p>
